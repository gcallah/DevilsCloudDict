                </a>
                the ability of a development team to nimbly shift blame for
                any faults in their product to the customer, operations,
                the vendor, management, the shareholders, regulators, or
                competitors, as appropriate to each specific failure.
            </li>

                <span class="hilight">CI/CD pipeline</span>:
                </a>
                a high-speed method for getting your latest bugs out into 
                production.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="containerization">
                <span class="hilight">containerization</span>:
                </a>
                the idea that, if all of the flaws in one's product are tightly
                bundled into a "container," then there is really only one flaw
                present.
            </li>

                <a name="continuous deployment">

                </a>
                the attempt by IT to subject the business to a stream of bugs
                so relentless that the business will passively 
                submit to whatever bugs come next.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="data science">
                <span class="hilight">data science</span>:
                </a>
                a subset of mine engineering, one which studies the process of
                extracting enormous fees from corporate customers using only a
                minimal knowledge of statistics and the ability to create a
                Python notebook.
            </li>

                <a name="integration testing">
                <span class="hilight">integration testing</span>:
                </a>
                automated tests to determine if an IT department has a
                sufficient number of representatives of various trendy
                categories of employee.
            </li>

                <span class="hilight">kanban board</span>:
                </a>
                a project management technique based on the idea that, if a 
                development group is faced with an impossible-to-fulfill set of
                demands, putting each demand on a post-it note will enable the
                group to finish them all in a timely fashion.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="microservices">
                <span class="hilight">microservices</span>:
                </a>
                an architectural strategy for giving every development team 
                a task miniscule enough to leave plenty of time for surfing
                StackOverflow for new job offers.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="repository">
                <span class="hilight">repository</span>:
                </a>
                a single, unique place in which every error made in developing
                a project can be collected: for the business, quite similar to
                a suppository.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Slack">
                <span class="hilight">Slack</span>:
                </a>
                The look developers' jaws take on after spending the majority
                of the hours in their work week receiving random queries about
                code they didn't write and giphies of dancing babies and
                laughing cartoon superheros.
            </li>

                <a name="The Cloud">

                </a>
                    an attempt by IT to escape all blame for future
                    data processing disasters by rendering the entire
                    computing infrastructure completely nebulous.
