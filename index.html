                <a name="agile development">
                <span class="hilight">agile development</span>:
                </a>
                the ability of a development team to nimbly shift blame for
                any faults in their product to the customer, operations,
                management, the shareholders, regulators, or competitors,
                as appropriate to each specific failure.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="CI/CD pipeline">
                <span class="hilight">CI/CD pipeline</span>:
                </a>
                a high-speed method for getting your latest bugs out into 
                production.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="containerization">
                <span class="hilight">containerization</span>:
                </a>
                the idea that, if all of the flaws in one's product are tightly
                bundled into a "container," then there is really only one flaw
                present.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="continuous deployment">
                <span class="hilight">continuous deployment</span>:
                </a>
                the attempt by IT to subject the business to a stream of bugs
                so relentless that the business will passively 
                submit to whatever bugs come next.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="data science">
                <span class="hilight">data science</span>:
                </a>
                a subset of mine engineering, one which studies the process of
                extracting enormous fees from corporate customers using only a
                minimal knowledge of statistics and the ability to create a
                Python notebook.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="integration testing">
                <span class="hilight">integration testing</span>:
                </a>
                automated tests to determine if an IT department has a
                sufficient number of representatives of various trendy
                categories of employee.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="kanban board">
                <span class="hilight">kanban board</span>:
                </a>
                a project management technique based on the idea that, if a 
                development group is faced with an impossible-to-fulfill set of
                demands, putting each demand on a post-it note will enable the
                group to finish them all in a timely fashion.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="repository">
                <span class="hilight">repository</span>:
                </a>
                a single, unique place in which every error made in developing
                a project can be collected: for the business, quite similar to
                a suppository.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="The Cloud">
                <span class="hilight">The Cloud</span>:
                </a>
                    an attempt by IT to escape all blame for future
                    data processing disasters by rendering the entire
                    computing infrastructure completely nebulous.
